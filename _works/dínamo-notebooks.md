title: ENABLED FOR DISABLED
category: Identity
description: |-
  People with disabilities have less access to health care, and these do not meet your real needs.

  The motto "Enabled for Disabled" needs to exalt equal opportunities and rights for people with disabilities.

  As designers we have the role to combat discrimination, inequality and ensure that every one is considered equal members of society.
