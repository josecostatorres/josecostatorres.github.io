title: ENABLED FOR DISABLED
category: Identity
description: |-
  People with disabilities have less access to health care, and these do not meet your real needs.

  Disability is not just a health problem. Itâ€™s a complex phenomenon which reflects the interaction between the characteristics of a person's body
  and the characteristics of the society where it lives.

  The motto "Enabled for Disabled" needs to exalt equal opportunities and rights for people with disabilities.

  As designers we have the role to combat discrimination, inequality and ensure that every one are considered equal members of society.
